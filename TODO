TODO:
- Switch the navbar to match relative URLs against page.url rather than titles.

Known Problems:
- Sections collapsed using Bootstrap's collapse feature should start collapsed.
  The collapse animation on page load is distracting and doesn't really add
  anything for intuitiveness beyond what the "view details" buttons do.
